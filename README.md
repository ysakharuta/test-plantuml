#Plantuml diagram picture
This is example of 2 important things
1) how to store and view diagrams in git. There is a stong evidence that team will do better job in keeping documentation and diagrams of their solution if diagram sources are stored and viewed from corresponding git repo owned by team, e.g wallet diagrams are in their repo instead of confluence or some shared company-wide repo.
2) How to share pieces of diagrams. In this example styles are reused, but any piece of diagram can be reused, not only styles.
